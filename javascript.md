# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

## JavaScript
- programming language that:
    1. has dynamic language 
    2. has first class functionality
        - first- class functions- very important aspect of JavaScript.functions can be passed around, able to head back after a certain action, and can be inserted into variables.

- "lightweight interpreted programming language" (*via* "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript")

- allows developer to place unique and complex factors within their website. 
    - ie functions, variables, prompts etc

## API
- Application Programming Interface
    - Essentially, it is a "cheat sheet" of sorts of already created programs that can be inserte in one's code. 

### Global Scope

- page that can easily accessed anywhere from the JavaScript program.

### Static vs Dynamic

**Static** - no login and remains the same
**Dynamic* - The ability of a webpage to present many different types of functions given many different scenarios.

## Input and Output 
    - In the example from the article by CodeMaven (via "https://code-maven.com/input-output-in-plain-javascript), the user wanted to create a "function" where one enters the name (input) and a response prompt (output).
