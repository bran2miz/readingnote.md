# Operator and Loops

## Binary operator 
- two operands

## Unary operator
- single operand or can be paired with operator

## Assignment operator
-the value of the left operand is based on the right operand.

## Comparison Operators
- Operators that compare operands and returns the statement as true or false.

== & !== - strict equality and inequality comparisons 

## Arithmetic operators

- ie increment and decrement
    > if x=3, solve X++ or ++X
    > if it is an increment- the X++ would be 4 
    > if it is a decrement- ++X=3 then would set to 4

## Bitwise Operators
    - places operands as a set of 32 bits

## Logical Operators
- returns a Boolean value.
- * & || operators
- return the value of the operand before it.

## String Operatros 
- console.log(my + 'string')
- equates to "my string"

## Unary Operators
- one operand

## Delete Operator
-object property deletion

## for statements
    - repeats until the function proves false.
    -intializes start end and increments

## while statements
    - continues to run so long as the condition remains true.
