# Markdown Notes

When I first learned coding in high school, the coding format was not only long but seemingly difficult. For example using the symbols, *<* and *>*, it would look something like this:

> i.e. < html>
>      < body>< /body>
>          < /html>

However, learning markdown has has shown me the wonders on how technology has truly changed over the course of a decade. In the most simplest of terms, markdown is the newest language to create one's own webpage. Used on the plaform known as Github, **writing codes that once took _several hours_** (in my case several days), takse only a few minutes with **markdown**. From creating a unique and impressive resume, to just creating a fun website for whatever your passionate about, markdown and github has made coding easy!

According to GitHub's youtube video, "What is GitHub Pages?", [(2016, August, 22), *What is GitHub Pages?* (Video) Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MsN8gpT6jY&t=64s], anyone can access websites that one has created using a personal url from the profile created from their website. On one's profile, they can create repositories, or a collection of files and folders, that can be later changed to a name of one's own choosing that can be used personally! There is even an option to change your themes for the website that best matches one's personal taste. For those having further troubles with their websites, or just want an experts opinion, there is even an option to mention them! Use the @ symbol and typing, @github/ support (insert question here) will "bring up a list of experts" come to assist you (Source: via github forum). Those who want to alert their coworkers or people that are a part of the website team can use the "@" symbol as well.

There are a number of excited and new aspects of markdown that you can experience for yourself that will ~~excited~~ **Blow Your Mind!!** With a simple asteric sign * one can make text **Bold** and *italic*. You can even **do _both_** using an underscore. Utilizing the "~" symbol twice, you can ~~cross out text!~~ Writing new headings would be such a pain, but now

### One can make a heading just with the *#* key.

Creating tables is such a breeze! Using the symbol, *-* and |,

> * Your Own (|) Table 
> * -------- (|) ----- (adding "-" to separate the first heading text from the below cells)
> * Add your own text in the first box here |(pressing shift + \ to separate each cell)

Your Own | Table
-------- | -----
Add your own text in the first box here |(pressing shift + \ to separate each cell)

This is only scratching the surface in terms of what markdown and GitHub can provide in creating a website. GitHub may appear extremely difficult. But as one experiments and goes through trial and error, a new web developer may learn that coding is not only made easy through markdown and GitHub, but also extremely **FUN!**
