# Structure web pages with HTML

### UX WireFrame 

- low fidelity design of a digital interface.
- a wonderful tool used for diffrent design choices. 

**2 different types of Wire Frame**

1. Hand drawn sketch
2. Digital Sketch

**Most Importantly: Keep the Wire Frame simple**

### Steps in Creating UX WireFrame

#### 1. Research

- it is important to research through data analysis and ask questions
    - "Who is your audience"
    - "Competitors and research of the company"

#### 2. Quick Research Reference

- Create a cheat sheet w/ 
    1. Business and Goals
    2. Features that other competitors don't have

#### 3. User Flow Mapped Out

#### 4. Draft and Sketch

#### 5. Details and Testing

### HTML Basics

#### HTML (HypterText Markup Language)
   
 - A series of elements that ensures enclosure of contents.
    -Essentially, a way to make a website appear the way you want it to look.

#### Tags
- enclosed elements that have different functions to formulate a website. 

< p>I love to walk on the beach< /p> - entire line is an element
    - < p> - opening tag (the start of the element)
    - "I love to walk on the beach - content
    - </ p> - closing tag (end of the element)

< p> stands for **Paragraph**

< p=class"editor note"  > I like bread < /p>
< p=class="editor note" > - attribute
    - Attributes are extra information that don't appear on one's interface. 

#### Nesting
- Elements within elements 

> ie < p>I really like < strong> bread < /strong> and butter < /p>
> - the strong element is considered nesting

#### Empty elements
    - elements with no content or feature

#### Writing HTML

< !DOCTYPE html> - **very important** tag as it defines the entire html 

< html></ html> - wraps code

< head> - Particular items that you don't want the user on your website to see. 

< body> - contains everything that you want to showcase on your webpage to your visitors.

< img> - image link

< img src= "images/firefox-icon.png alt= "my test image"> 
    - src is the *source*, or, where the file can be obtained.
    - alt is the *visual text* in the event that there are problems with seeing the image and a text is needed to visualize.

#### Heading Elements

Heading elements are used to give titles to certain parts of the content. 

> ie < h1> Title < /h1>
>    < h1> My top level < /h2>

#### Lists

There are two types of list elements

##### 1. Unordered Lists are the list elements in which the content order  is not important.

##### 2. Ordered Lists are the opposite- list element in which the content order is important.

> ie < ul>
>      < li>builder</ li>
>      < li> thinkers</ li>
>    < /ul>

#### Links

To add a link, enter the tag, < a>, as well as including href (or hypertext reference).

> ie < ahref="https://mozilla.org>Mozilla Manifesto< /a>

### Semantics

*Semantics* is defined as the purpose of a specific fragment within the code.

> < h1>< /h1> is an example of a semantic element used in HTML

#### Benefits of Semantic Markup

1. Boost user's visitation with "important keywords" through search engines, like google.

2. Allows developers easy acces to navigate through individual code.
