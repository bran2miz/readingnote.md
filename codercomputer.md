# Reading notes for the article entitled, "Choosing a Text Editor", by the user, "The Older Coder"

## Different Classifications of Text Editors

In the world of coding, text editing tools enable the ability to use code language, which allows one to essentially *"create a website"*. However, according to this article, it can be extremely nerve-wrecking to decide which editing tools to choose from. There is a mulititude of text editors out there, so choosing one really depends on what best suits each individual. This article described **three** different types of text editors and their different variates. This information could provide hopeful coders to narrow down which tool could most benefit them. 

### 1. The already installed Software

- According to writer, he states:

> that a computer user should have one software installed **already**! 

**Text Edit** is the most primitive computer software out there. There are many variates to notepad:

1. On linux computers, the text editor could go by the name of "Gedit".
2. On Windows computers, the text editor could go by the software called "Notepad".

Although easily accessed for the majority of computer users, Text Edit **does not** possess alot of important and/or extraneous features. Features that are not included are as follows:

1. *Code completion* - text that appears in the editor. It "completes" a code to prevent an editor in making errors.
2. *Syntax highlighting* - Different parts of the text that are separated by various colors, allowing the coder to revise errors.
3. Themes- A *neat* feature in the text editor to change the background and color of the text to easily rectify mistakes, or add new coding.

### 2. Third Party Software

- Third Party Software are the text editors in which you can install. Some examples that the article lists are as follows:

1. Notepad++
2. Text Wrangler
3. BB Edit
4. Visual Studio Code
5. Atom
6. Brackets
7. Sublime Text

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) created by Microsoft, has everything you need in a text editing software! All of the mentioned features that text edit did not possess, VS Code can accomplish and more!

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

IDE is essentially a "one-stop shop" for everything you need to edit your text for coding. 

1. First and foremost, it is a text editor
2. Manages files
3. Debugs 
4. Translates computer programming text into code that the computer is able to process. 

The blogger did mention that whilst he uses third party software, the more immersed one becomes in the world of coding, being able to use IDE should come naturally.

# Reading Notes for Terminal Articles

## How Commands Are Used

- Commands are implored through text in an area known as **The Terminal**. The terminal receives a specific command from the User, which then prompts a response. 

### Steps for the Terminal

1. Type in command 
  - ie (ls) is a command, the abbrievation for list.
2. Terminal agrument- changes the conduct of the remaining chains of command 
  - ie ( -l) 
3. Feedback is issued after command is processed.
4. Upon the completion of the command, the terminal loops and starts back again with what is known as the "prompt" (via "https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php").

### Shell

The shell is essentially the area that allows the user to see how the commands are behaving (or not behaving) in the terminal.
  - An example of a shell is called bash, which is an acronym for "Bourne again shell". 

#### Commands Basics within the Shell

##### pwd

Like the acronym for PWD suggests, the printing working directory essentially "prints" the directory. 

##### Paths- A way in which to obtain "a file or diretory" within the terminal (via "https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php"). 

According to this article, there are two types of paths, the absolute path, and the relative path. Both paths purposefully locate a specfic file. However the differerence between the two is the actual location. The absolute path locates a file witihin what is known as the root directory, or, the main area where all the subfiles are located. The relative path is the location to which the user is in at presently.
